# Bit logic calculator

This app takes 2 binary numbers and outputs the bitwise AND, OR and XOR results. Will be pushing the incremental stages of the development process to Github in order to practice both the usage of command line git and also developing code in stages towards a final product as opposed to everything at once.

Commit 1: 
    - initial code that takes user input and verifies it is a binary number

Commit 2: 
    - accidentally deleted s.close() from previous commit. Adding code
    = added request to user for second binary number
    - moved invalid entry message to method that checks for valid binary number
